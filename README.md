# Conversions
The purpose of this REPO was to house the scripts I write for converting files of a certain type to other files of a certain type. For example, some of the comicbooks I have are in PDF format and I wanted to convert them to CBZ so they can be read in a comicbook reader.

File Converter 
This script prompts you what file type you want to convert (shows you a list of supported file types) and then it asks you what filetype you want to conver to (and shows you a list of filetypes it supports). I built this as a template that I can expand as I need more file conversions. (I am open to suggestions). As of now it will convert PDF to CBZ and vice versa. 

All you have to do is make a folder on your desktop called "PDF" and put your pdf files in it. You can also put folders in it that contain pdf files. Then run the script and it will put the converted CBZ files in a folder on your desktop called "Output." If you had the pdf files in a folder nested in the PDF folder, then it will create that same folder name within Output.
